## Description
HashMap is a data structure that allows for efficient searching and insertion of key-value pairs. This implementation uses linear probing to handle collisions.

The algorithm uses a hash function to calculate the index for a given key, and stores the key-value pair in that index. If the index is already occupied, the algorithm will continue to probe for the next available index.

This implementation provides explanations for each step in the code comments, making it easier for users to understand how HashMap works.
